# Assignment Description
## Program 2 - Pointers and Bits
### Due Date: 5:00 p.m., September 28th, 2018

*All programs will be tested on the machines in the Q22 lab. If your code does not run on the system in this lab, it is considered non-functioning EVEN IF IT RUNS ON YOUR PERSONAL COMPUTER. Always check that your code runs on the lab machines before submitting.*

### Driver Code and Test Files

* program2.c //Driver Code
   * Include the driver code with your submission, but do not alter it.

### Grading Rubric

**_TOTAL: 20 points_**
* **Part A: 12 points**
    * myStrStr function works with all test cases (12 points / 2 for each case)
* **Part B: 7 points**
    * Passes Counting 1’s test (2 points) (must pass all tests)
    * Passes Binary Tests (5 points total / 1 point each)
* **Part C: 1 points**
    * Follows requested program structure and submission format

### Guidelines

This is an individual assignment. You must do the vast majority of the work on your own. It is permissible to consult with classmates to ask general questions about the assignment, to help discover and fix specific bugs, and to talk about high level approaches in general terms. It is not permissible to give or receive answers or solution details from fellow students.

You may research online for additional resources; however, you may not use code that was written specifically *to* solve the problem you have been given, and you may not have anyone else help you write the code or solve the problem. You may use code snippets found online, providing that they are appropriately and clearly cited, within your submitted code.

*By submitting this assignment, you agree that you have followed the above guidelines regarding collaboration and research.*

__In this program, you will learn to__:

* Work with pointers
* Work with binary values

## Part A: String Manipulations

In the second program you will create a library file containing 4 functions. I have provided driver code that runs and tests your library code. You will need to create a second file that can be included in the driver code so the compiler can link them into an executable.

To include a file in c, use the preprocessing statement `#include` and the name of the file as a string at the top of your code. I have included a file called “mylib.h” in the driver code provided. This means you must write all of your code in a file called “mylib.h” and place it in the same directory as the provided driver code for the program to compile.

* For this part of the program you will implement your own version of the library function [strstr()](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strstr/), with the following function interface:
int myStrStr (char  * haystack, char * needle, char * buffer);
   * Your function will take 3 strings, a 'haystack' string, a 'needle' string, and a buffer string. You will search the haystack string for a sequence matching the needle string, and copy the found result (the entire substring) from the haystack string into the buffer (do not copy the needle string).
   * You will return a 1 if the matching sequence in the haystack is found and a 0 if the needle is not found.
   * You can not use the library strstr() function in your implementation. It is only for reference.
   * I will test your function with the following hardcoded strings. Do not ask for user input.
   * haystack="chocolate", needle="choc"
   * haystack="vanilla", needle="lla"
   * haystack="caramel", needle="am"
   * haystack="strawberry", needle="strawberry"
   * haystack="banana", needle="na"
   * haystack="cherry", needle="terrible"

## Part B: Bits and Bytes

First you will write a function that counts the number of 1’s in the binary representation of an integer passed as a parameter to a function called `countOnes()` :bulb: _see driver code for exact interface_. You should return the number of 1s in the function’s parameter as an int.

Next you will write a looping binary interpreter that creates an array representation of a binary value.
* Write a function that uses **bit shifting** to store the binary representation of an integer in an array passed as a parameter. You will be given the size of the array and should make sure you fill out all elements in the array. To generate the array of values, you will need to use a bit mask and bitwise right shift.
    * 8 would store the following value in your array
        * 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1000
* The provided driver code (main) which calls your binaryArray function with each of the below values and an array buffer to print the binary representation (from right to left) for each one:
    * 2
    * 255
    * -1
    * INT_MAX
    * INT_MIN
* :bulb: The driver code includes the library <limits.h> at the top of the main source code file so you can use the global constant INT_MAX and INT_MIN


## Part C: Submission
* Required code naming and organization:
    * program2.c
    * mylib.h

:no_entry: Every program will have a required submission guidelines. Please read submission requirements carefully. Any deviations from specifications will result in point deductions or incomplete grades.

## README

* KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS
* REFERENCES
* MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS

Before your final submission, edit the content for each of these sections in this README for your program. You do not have to use markdown, but you can find out more about markdown [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) if you would like to.

### Git

Below is a reminder of the commands you need to use to submit your program.

:warning: *These commands all presume that your current working directory is within the directory tracked by `git`.*

```shell
git status
git add mylib.h
git commit -a -m "commit message"
git push
```

To find your most recent commit hash, use the following command:

```shell
git rev-parse HEAD
```    

To complete your submission, you must copy and paste this number into mycourses. Go to MyCourses, select cs580u, and **Assignment Hash Submission**.

:warning: You __MUST__ submit the commit hash on mycourses before the deadline to be considered on time **even if your program is completely working before the deadline**. :warning:
